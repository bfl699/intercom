# Using the Discrete Wavelet Transform, convert the chunks of samples
# intro chunks of Wavelet coefficients (coeffs).
#
# The coefficients require more bitplanes than the original samples,
# but most of the energy of the samples of the original chunk tends to
# be into a small number of coefficients that are localized, usually
# in the low-frequency subbands:

# (each channel must be transformed independently)
#
# This means that the most-significant bitplanes, for most chunks
# (this depends on the content of the chunk), should have only bits
# different of 0 in the coeffs that belongs to the low-frequency
# subbands. This will be exploited in a future issue.
#
# The straighforward implementation of this issue is to transform each
# chun without considering the samples of adjacent
# chunks. Unfortunately this produces an error in the computation of
# the coeffs that are at the beginning and the end of each subband. To
# compute these coeffs correctly, the samples of the adjacent chunks
# i-1 and i+1 should be used when the chunk i is transformed:
#
#   chunk i-1     chunk i     chunk i+1

# +------------+------------+------------+
#
# O = sample
#
# (In this example, only 2 samples are required from adajact chunks)
#
# The number of ajacent samples depends on the Wavelet
# transform. However, considering that usually a chunk has a number of
# samples larger than the number of coefficients of the Wavelet
# filters, we don't need to be aware of this detail if we work with
# chunks.
